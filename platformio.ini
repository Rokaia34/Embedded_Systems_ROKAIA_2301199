; Each environment here has its own main code (case1_UART_TX_Button, case2_UART_RX_Led, test1â€¦test11)
; Only the folder with the main() for that environment is compiled.
; This allows each case or test to build independently in VS Code/PlatformIO,
; because `including other folders with main() caused compilation errors before.
